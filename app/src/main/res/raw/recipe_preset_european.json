    "ingredients": "9 oz Dried European soldier beans|6 oz Mild Gorgonzola cheese|1/2 c Minced fresh sage (you may substitute fresh rosemary, but not dried sage)|1/2 c Extra-virgin olive oil",
    "servings": "1 Servings",
    "instructions": "The first step in cooking most dried legumes is soaking them. The traditional method of soaking beans calls for a soak of 6 to 12 hours. After picking the beans over and washing them, you should cover them with tepid water until they're submerged far under the surface of the water. Change the water a few times, especially if your kitchen is warm. There is a shorter way to soak your beans, if you want to be more spontaneous. Pick over and wash the beans, then cover them entirely with hot water in a large saucepan. Boil the beans for 2 minutes, then cover with a lid, remove pot from heat, and let soak for an hour. When ready to cook, rinse the beans (soaked either way) in tepid water. Cover the beans by 2 inches with unsalted cold water in a medium saucepan. Bring to boil, reduce heat, and cover partially. Cook for 60 to 90 minutes, or until beans are soft. The beans should be covered by water at all times; you will probably have to add more water to the beans to keep them completely immersed. Keep a kettle of water at a simmer for this purpose"

Stir twice while mashing. Test the mash conversion by placing drop of mash onto white plate, then place a drop of iodine into the solution. If solution turns purple/black you must continue the mash until the solution is clear when the iodine is added. Pour mash thru a strainer, allowing the wort to flow thru into your brew pot. Bring 1-2 gal water to 135-150 degrees. Slowly sparge the grains with sparge water until it runs clear. The sparge water will become part of the boil. At this point you will continue as usual. Dissolve malt extract and brown sugar into wort, add 1 oz northern brewer hops and boil for 45 min. Add 1/2 oz plug and boil for 15 min more. For the last 5 min of the boil, add the fuggles pellets. Cool the wort and bring volume up to 5 gal. Pitching temp: 80 or less : Jaspers"
