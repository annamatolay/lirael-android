In a separate bowl, sift flour with baking powder; add creamed mixture and blend well. Roll dough into a log and wrap in aluminum foil. Chill overnight, or in freezer for 2 hours if rushed for time. Preheat oven to 350ø. Remove dough from refrigerator, slice very thin and place on greased cookie sheet. Bake 5-8 minutes at 350ø. Variations: For various holidays decorate with colored sugar, beads or icing. Or substitute almond or lemon extract for the vanilla to vary the flavor. Yield: 10 dozen. Suzanne J.

Add the coriander, cumin, turmeric and the tomato and continue to cook until it turns dry. Remove from the heat and cool down. In a large mixing bowl, combine crabmeat, the cooled onion mixture, shrimp, chopped lime zest and juice, cilantro, chives, beaten egg and 3 tablespoons of the panko. Season with salt, pepper and cayenne. Mix well so that all the ingredients are well incorporated. Test a small quantity by forming a teaspoon of this mix into a small patty and frying it in a pan. Adjust the salt and pepper if necessary. Divide this mixture into 4 equal portions. Form into balls and flatten to form small patties. Put the rest of the panko on a cutting board. Place the patties one at a time in the bread crumbs. Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet large enough to hold the crab cakes on medium heat. Add the oil and fry the crab cakes. When the cakes turn a light golden color, flip them over and cook them on the other side until they are light golden in color. Using a slotted spatula, remove and drain on a paper towel. Take 4 large plates and place the baby greens in the centers and a pappadum on top of the greens. Fill each pappadum with a scoop of Avocado Salad and top with a crab cake. Spoon the tamarind around the plate. This recipe yields 4 servings."
