This is a friendly recipe finder that encourages you to cook more with cool statistics. It can offer random recipes, presets, and search options. It also guides you through on the instructions. And it's full of kittens. üêà

It's a Kotlin, MVI app with XML views, RxJava 3, Koim, Moshi, and Retrofit. Based on my [template project](https://github.com/annamatolay/template-android-xml).

**Disclaimer:** The app is in early access [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.anmatolay.lirael) and will be released once testing and code clean-up is finished.

_(More details coming soon.)_
